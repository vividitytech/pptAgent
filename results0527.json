Anyways, realizing I'm in a full on depressive spell and need a spot to I guess, vent or talk or just get this out somewhere that isn't my head. \n\nSo have been struggling financially for 2+ years now. I've come to the realization that I'm severely underpaid for the work I do (projects manager at a company that works in publishing, I make $40k a year and I'm discovering I should be making closer to $80k) which wasn't a problem, but a series of financial setbacks has resulted in me now having an extra $10k in credit card debt on top of what I had previously and I can't keep up with day to day expenses anymore. Recently our work (me and GF work at the same company) changed health insurances, which resulted in not only me having to continue paying out of pocket for her doctor, one of the meds she needs isn't covered by the new plan. Resulting in another $100 a month I need to come up with. \n\nI've been at my company for 7+ years, and with a bunch of freelance side work I did while here, I can confidently say my resume is one of somebody who knows my industry super well. But in my hunt for a new job, I have gotten literally 1 human response from somebody who cancelled our interview a day later because \"the position was filled over the weekend\". I've gotten some pointers and feedback from people on resume/cover letter and nothing I do seems to make a difference. I can't get a clear indication if the job market is THIS bad or if there's just something wrong with me and I need to try something totally new. \n\nRecently, GF had to check into the hospital for about 2 weeks, I was covering her duties at work (I was pulling nonstop 11-12 hour days doing her job, and my job which is also more work than I should be doing). She finally came home which was great, but she met a friend there and I'm not sure if this is a genuine friend or a \"I found somebody better than you\" situation in the making. I know he's into her that way, I don't know if it's reciprocal. It's close to her time of the month and she gets a little weird emotionally which is exacerbating this feeling. We've been together for 6 1/2 years, so I recognize this. Fortunately I have the self-control to NOT put that insecurity onto her, I realize this is a me thing. But it just feels shitty being the person doing so much to keep our house running and she's out with somebody else. Like I'm just here for as a bank account/chef. We don't have sex that frequently, she's on anti-depressants, so I don't have comfort in that/it's compounding with this feeling of being used. If anyone watches Helluva Boss, I've been relating to Stolas a little more than I should (especially with the last episode)\n\nI dunno, it's just been really hard for a long time now. I need some kind of win or something to feel good about and I don't know if that's coming. Had a bit of a break down last night, a car almost hit me (driver wasn't looking) and I realized I didn't feel anything about it. I want to stress I'm not looking to harm myself, so I don't want anyone reading this to panic about this internet stranger. Not sure how to close this from here, but if anyone does read this, I appreciate the time and effort spent to listen. ",

            "Hi there! It definitely helps me to get all my thoughts out, so it\u2019s great that you are able to vent. You also seem to understand that some of your thoughts are distorted and are just fears and not reality. Your issues sound a lot like my own. I put everything into the things I love and then expect that I will get the same in return. And when I don\u2019t, I become severely depressed bc I think I must not be worth that much to the people I love. Is that how you feel, that your girlfriend and work don\u2019t appreciate you and all the work you do? The first thing I learned was that I wanted to give my love, hard work, and compassion freely without expecting anything in return. Secondly, I had to quit finding my worth from how other people treated me. Instead, I have been judging myself on my own actions and principles. Neither one of us are responsible for the way other people treat us. That\u2019s on them. The only thing we can do is be open about our feelings and needs with the people we care about. What they choose to do with that information is on them and a reflection on them, not us. Being confident that you are a good person isn\u2019t easy, I have to constantly review my actions to confirm that I\u2019m not terrible. You sound like a very kind, thoughtful, hard working person. Sometimes you have to make sure that people are treating you the way you want to be treated. You should go to your boss and request a pay increase with points on why you deserve it. If they are not receptive then that will tell you everything about how much they value you, and that\u2019s on them. I don\u2019t know your career, but maybe you can explore a subreddit related to your career and see if you can find any advice there. Maybe do some networking on LinkedIn? If anything, having your girlfriend back at work now will give you the extra time to search for a new job. It\u2019s really hard to rise above the feeling that you must deserve to be treated poorly when it\u2019s the people closest to you. But people aren\u2019t usually doing things maliciously against you, they\u2019re acting based on their own insecurities, fears, and irrational thoughts. And a business is gonna business, there\u2019s a lot of companies more interested in making money than caring for their employees. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the problem, but bc you\u2019re compassionate and hardworking, you want to help fix it. We can\u2019t control other people, all we can do is set our limits and tell people when they start stretching those limits. And if they break them, we provide them a lesson that this behavior is unacceptable. It\u2019s up to them if they learn their lesson and become better for it. I wish you nothing but happiness and good fortune in the future!",
            "Hey, thanks for the kind words. It genuinely means a lot. This might sound greedy I guess, GF struggles with a few mental things (depression, ADHD, PTSD, etc.) so she struggles a lot to get things done on the daily. I have to be the \"stronger one\" a lot of the time, which I don't mind doing because I love her. But that's where I guess some of the insecurity starts to seep in, I may do a lot in a day and then there isn't really any kind of reciprocation back. I don't want it to sound like she's unloving/caring, when it's not this time of the month she's super sweet and loving that's not an issue there. I guess it's kind of like the sitcom trope of the woman making a dinner, getting a sexy outfit on, but finding the man asleep on the couch after all of that. Like tonight, she's going to an amusement park with this new friend, I gave her some extra money in case there's something she wants and needs extra for, and I picked up some steaks to cook when she gets back. But I'm sure she's just going to go to sleep or something because she's tired from being out and it feels shitty that somebody else got to have a fun day with her and not me. Sometimes it feels like I'm doing SO much and all I'm getting in return is somebody who'll sit in my arms to watch TV (which I do love, I want to stress that). \n\nAnd I think that's good advice, I've used more general job type forums but haven't checked a reddit for my field (this I'm being super vague on because it would immediately give away it's me if anyone did see this). I haven't gotten much responses on Linkedin follows, but that's another avenue that isn't full of scam/AI bots lol. \n\nYou kind of nailed it on the head, it feels like I do a lot for a lot of people, I don't want anyone to ever feel like I have been as of recent, so I kind of bend over backwards whenever somebody needs help. And it feels like I don't have a lot of that in return. I struggle a bit vocalizing my feelings (I'm working on it), maybe I'll try and work up the courage to express this in a way with redacting the parts that'd be hurtful/accusatory. \n\nAppreciate the kindness again, just having somebody being like \"hey, I see and hear you\" feels good. I wish all the same to you as well!",
            "You don\u2019t sound greedy, you sound like someone who\u2019s been working very hard and don\u2019t feel like your efforts are being seen and reciprocated. My therapist recently told me that while I\u2019m the source of support and compassion for my family they may not be able to do that for me. Which is a really hard pill to swallow that I can\u2019t expect the same when I need it. But I\u2019m trying to remember that everyone is different and everyone has some value and wisdom to offer. We can\u2019t expect people to give what we give or do what we do. If we did, then our compassion and hard work wouldn\u2019t be special. You are worthy because of your actions, how you treat others, and because you\u2019re a fellow human being. And your feelings are valid simply because you feel them. I think talking to your girlfriend about how you feel, making sure to emphasize that you don\u2019t think she\u2019s doing anything wrong, but that you are in need of reassurance and love. You\u2019ve been working extra hard and it seems like you need someone to acknowledge how hard you\u2019ve been working and to appreciate you. I know that you may think that you\u2019re being greedy because you want more and it may come across like you don\u2019t think your girlfriend is doing enough. But I don\u2019t think that you feel that way, I think you just need extra compassion because of how much extra you\u2019ve been doing. The best kind of compassion is the compassion that comes from within. It helps me to see myself as if I were thinking about a close friend. Sadly, I think my friends deserve more compassion and acknowledgement than I do, but when I think of myself as a separate person it helps me see myself truly. And truly, I think that you deserve a little compassion and love from yourself. You\u2019re doing a great job, and you seem like a very kind and hardworking person. Give some of that love to yourself now that you\u2019re able to take a little breather. \ud83d\udc99",

All of that love has run dry. I have no means of leaving because of a lack of a vehicle and job because of no vehicle. He refused to help me take a loan out to get it fixed bc he will not use our savings which i also don\u2019t have access to  and his constant spending has already put me so far in the hole that the home that i owned prior to marriage and was fully paid off now has a $50k lien on it.  He will not leave and i have no means of forcing him to as all of my earnings have went to debt and the money i had has been used up on bills since i have had no income from not car.  Why can\u2019t he just see this is toxic and he needs to leave. Why make us both suffer. I just hate my life anymore. I have nothing since him. I have lost everything. I also shouldn\u2019t have to be the one to leave considering this is MY HOME. I feel like a burden on my friends because who wants to talk to someone who is so depressed out of their mind they can\u2019t even hold a conversation.

I have to share a double suite with another dude and 2 gals, and I'm scared I won't be able to cut myself as often due to us all sharing one bathroom. Hurting myself has been what's kept me sane and probably is the reason I haven't tried to kms yet. But that'll all change. I'm scared to talk to anyone about it because they'll either hate me, think I'm fucking mentally deranged, or will want to commit me to a facility. I haven't told anyome about this in 4-5 years, since it started when I was 13. I fucking hate this so much and it's only getting worse and I don't want to hurt others but I don't know if I'll be able to keep going. I can't get emotionally connected with people (though I fake it really well), intimacy scares the living fuck out of me so I'll probably die alone, and I'll never vent this shit to anyone. I can't even cry anymore. Like I physically can't well up tears and when I do, they dry up instantly. Like I try to cry and scream this shit out but nothing happens or comes out. I'm cutting longer and more frequently, going deeper. It's like a fucking high at this point. I just want to get a needle of heroin or morphine or some shit, stick it in my arm, pump myself full, and quietly overdose in my bed. It's painless, my body stays pristine for a funeral, and easy to hide. But I won't do it because I'm a fucking coward. I just want to cry, to cry to someone, but it'll never fucking happen.

I have questionable habits that I\u2019d rather not get into here but it makes me think that I can be a bad person.

There are better people out there than me.\n\n And they expect me to become a functioning and contributing member of society. To do great things with my life. To succeed. But I just can\u2019t.

The amount of things I've failed is astonishing and I've never achieved or accomplished anything ever either. \n\nEveryone says \"you haven't tried\" or \"your still young, this is the time to fail\" orrrrrrr \"no one is born knowing how to do things, it takes practice and dedication\" or some equivalent of one of those. Let me run through all my failures that I've documented;\n\n1. Failed swimming classes on 2 separate occasions. Didn't even pass level 1. \n\n2. Failed music despite learning 3 different instruments over the course of 5yrs. \n\n3. Failed karate even after 3yrs of effort.\n\n4. Failed college on 3 separate occasions. Before college I did fine ig. But even if you spin that in a positive light, at best I only \"peaked\" in high school which is not something to be proud of. \n\n5. Failed my G1 Test. G1 here is just part 1 of your drivers test that you do at like 16yrs old. It's a 40 question test about road signs and stuff. I failed that. \n\n6. Can't cook to save my life. I couldn't even boil tofu without royally screwing it up (which is one of the things idc about because I hate eating and food in general and I don't deserve to eat anyway. Food is a privilege for those who deserve it. And I don't deserve that privilege. Plus, starving feels good to me).\n\n7. I can't even drive. Took me 6yrs to get my license (it's supposed to be 3yrs where I live) and even then I only passed by literally 1 point cause I can't control the pedals still. I accelerate and brake wayyyyyyy to hard.\n\n8. Tried being a YouTuber since 2015. Nothing. Not even close. Videos barely get over 30 views. \n\n9. I was a tutor and cleaner at a high school before but failed that too. Did a terrible job tutoring according to my reference I used and the custodians completely ghosted me after I botched doing something as simple as cleaning lockers. \n\n10. Nowadays I supervise students during their lunch at a different school but I failed so hard my boss (the principal) told me she'll handle my usual class cause I failed miserably at getting them to listen to me. Not to mention most times teachers have to step in and help me control the class.\n\n11. How about something as simple as board games? Nope. You won't believe me, but I literally can't even beat my 5yr old cousin at Snakes and Ladders. And every other board game and even card game I consistently come in dead last 100% of the time when I play with my other cousins who are basically the same age as me. Not even exaggerating. \n\n12. I can't even have fun playing video games for God sake. Once again, every single game I've ever played, I come dead last. I've been playing Pok\u00e9mon for like 16yrs now and still can't win a serious battle for the life of me. Smash Bros is even worse. Despite playing a lot by myself, I can't even go even with my cousins who never play outside of when we play together. Clash of Clans, Brawl Stars, Clash Royale, Plants vs Zombies, Mario Kart, Mario Party, NHL, WWE, F-Zero, and on and on. All. The. Time. No matter what. It's always me coming in dead last. Even single player games I can't manage because I get so confused on the most basic stuff. Like, I've actually had to Google tutorials on Mario levels. Not to mention it took me like 10yrs to finally beat Super Monkey Ball, Sonic Heroes, 007: Agent Underfire and Nightfire. \n\n13. I was learning French for 9yrs straight but failed miserably as I can't hold a conversation because I don't understand anything. \n\n14. I can't even ride a bike. Need I say more?\n\n15. Despite being a supervisor for kids at an elementary school, it's more of a glorified volunteer position because it's only 1hr a day. I can't even find a job right, like wtf. Granted, I believe it's due to my empty resume cause I have nothing to leverage. No skills, no abilities, nothing.\n\n16. I can't even be pretty to look at! Chubby, acne, belly covered in stretch marks cause I actually lost weight (used to be 180lbs at 14, went down to 120lbs by 17, now back at 140lbs at 21 due to a medical accident. Nearly died).\n\n17. Friends? Partner? Forget it lol. I'm too ugly and have no personality or anything of value to anyone. Experience proves it. Never had friends, never had a partner or even dated. Get weird looks cause of how ugly I naturally am. Literally.\n\n18. I was in Cadets at one point. Failed that too cause I can't even follow directions properly.\n\n19. Art, Ice Skating, Woodwork, Rock Climbing, Robotics, Sports (soccer, basketball, tennis, lacrosse, volleyball, baseball, hockey, softball, handball, jump rope, running, beep test, endurance), computer programming. I failed all of these and it wasn't even close. I'm so comically bad that I needed the teacher to literally hold my hand and teach me 1on1 despite the rest of the class of 20+ not needing too and even then I somehow still failed.\n\n20. Can't even die. I know I should. I know it's the right thing to do, but I can't do it myself. It'll save everyone so much money, time, effort, and more.\n\n21. No social skills either. I have a studder not to mention I'm EXTREMELY awkward in social situations. This is without mentioning the times I actually passed out from being so anxious/scared.\n\n22. I even tried making my own website. I can't do it cause I don't understand any language, even one as basic as HTML. YouTube isn't helping because I still don't understand. I tried making my own games, and that's even harder because I don't understand any coding language. I even get stumped on using Scratch. I tried making my own analog horror series but I can't even use pre-made assets right.\n\n23. I can't even do the shopping right. I forget items even when I right it down. I don't understand how to use a points card. I can't calculate change and money in general.\n\n24. I can't do anything that requires strength cause I'm too weak. I get dragged across the coals for this one more recently. (Even tho I am fine with being weak)\n\n25. Even though English is the only language I speak, I suck at speaking it even beyond my studder. If I'm not studdering, I either speak too fast or mumble. And in writing, my penmanship is God awful. I even had to learn to write with one of those rubber prism things on my pencil. And nowadays is not much better. My penmanship is more akin to chicken scratch rather than legible words. \n\nMy folks don't even want me or like me. Been threatened to get kicked out if I fail college again (which is honestly fair. I know it's hard living with me after all the things I fail). Everyone always compares me to my cousins (all in university, 1 is a recent grad, another is buff and hell, other is a lifeguard and she's still a teen not to mention she can sing, dance, fluent French, has a good student job, black belt in Taikwondoe, honors student. She's LITERALLY never failed anything ever). Everyone even compares me to our neighbor and how well she's doing, she's also 21 but she comes home high and starts yelling so loud we can hear her from our house. And everyone still loves her. \n\nBeen to social workers and mental health workers but it doesn't matter. All the same advise \"everyone is good at something. Everyone is their own unique snowflake. You'll find your stride eventually\" or whatever. That's pure trash advise. Your is not guaranteed to be good at something.\n\nI want to talk about other advise I've been given and explain in my opinion why they are wrong. \n\n1. \"Looks don't matter. It's all about personality\". This is honestly one of the stupidest things ever. Looks matter as much as personality in my opinion. Ofc then everyone asks \"would you prefer be around someone pretty but treats everyone like trash or someone who's not conventionally pretty but has a good heart\". To which I respond, why the extremes? Looks always matter to everyone, even those who say it doesn't. As humans, we judge people based on appearance because it's easier and gives us a general sense of saftey. Also, it's always \"their hair, their voice, their body, their smile\", it's never \"their persoal goals align with my own. Or, they are so upstanding and selfless\". A positive energy/vibe can only get you so far, just like being pretty, it can only get you so far by itself. You need both. \n\n2. \"Change your mindset, change your life\". Counselors say this all the time in my experience. \"Surround yourself with positive thoughts and energy and it will change your mood\". Thinking positively doesn't change the fact that my life is down the drain cause I literally have never done anything right in my over 2 decades of living. Thinking about the birds outside or the sunny day may help in the moment, but realistically, it doesn't change my situation. I'm a failure. I deserve to die. No amount of cute birds or writing in a diary changes that unfortunately. \n\nI'm 110% confident that the only reason my family is putting up with me is out of obligation or guilt. Someone in my family (don't want to say who) even said they wished my cousins lived in our house instead of me.\n\nI know everyone on this sub means well and tries to help but I swear if anyone says like \"your good at making coherent sentences\" or \"your good at making lists\" or something, I'm gonna cry.\n\nI understand everyone has failed things before, and I know there are others who feel the same way I do but I can near guarantee you that you can at least do 1 of the things I listed. I bet my life on it. \n\nI'll keep updating that list and this post in general as I remember more things but that's all I have documented at the moment. ",

I've been putting homework off for so long that at this point I can't look at it, it will make me anxious to see whats piled up. I'm a screw up\n\nI dont even know how to explain my self hatred, I am just really fucking ugly and it makes me want to end my life. I don't see a point in living If im going to be a second rate human for the rest of my life, I think being adopted has to do somehting with this feeling but that's a different story I gues. I just feel fucking done, this is a new low luckyly I haven't yet turned to too much alcohol but idk\n\nI can't speak to anyone , no wya am I putting this burden on my frineds (as realistically all my issues are my own, theres nothing anyone can practically do for me so I don't wnat to involve others). This person I liked talking to wont talk to me and now I'm embarrassed but thats a smaller issue but he was nice to me. My mom will get mad if I tell her and I hardly speak to my dad, and he absolutely is not a person you speak to if y have emotional problems\n\nI dont know hat this post is I guess just a vent, but i jsust feel destroyed right now",

        "selftext": "I try just to be back in the same spot and worse than even before. I honestly don\u2019t think I\u2019m capable of being \u201cnormal\u201d. I go to the gym everyday (muay thai/bjj). I compete in it. I\u2019ve lost a shit ton of weight cause of it. I thought it would make me feel better and happy with life yet it\u2019s all the same shit. The same feeling of not being able to do anything. I\u2019ve failed almost all my courses in uni. My parents think I\u2019m doing good but if only they knew. I\u2019d just go and sit in my car staring blankly for hours doing nothing instead of going to my classes. My parents have a version of me in their head which I\u2019m not at all. They think I\u2019m religious when I don\u2019t believe in anything. I mean how could I? I ride a pretty fast motorcycle and for the longest time I\u2019ve been hoping one day someone just hits me and I don\u2019t have to wake up again. I have no regard for life anymore. I\u2019m sure if people look at me from the outside, they\u2019ll see a guy who has many hobbies and is \u201cdetermined\u201d. If only they knew how I feel. I\u2019ll workout my self to death just so I don\u2019t have to be in my thoughts but I can\u2019t workout forever. I\u2019m so hard to love. I really am. I\u2019m what you call a \u201cnice guy\u201d. I even met a girl recently a couple months ago. We share so much interests and I genuinely love everything about her. It\u2019ll make me sound insane but I don\u2019t allow women in my life cause I always end up catching feelings and these feelings are always not reciprocated. I stopped trying a long time ago cause it always ends up with me hurt. I know it\u2019s never her fault, I can\u2019t ask for them to love me. It\u2019s just a \u201cme\u201d problem. This girl I met recently, we\u2019d call every night for hours talking about the most random things to the deepest topics. We hung out a few times as well and we both enjoyed it. We even kissed. She told me she isn\u2019t looking for anything serious and just sees me as a friend. She does find me attractive and she\u2019d like to be fwbs only. I can\u2019t blame her if that\u2019s how she feels. It\u2019s totally fair and I appreciate her being honest with me about what she wants and her intentions. She does deeply care about me as a friend and I can see that. But that\u2019s not what I want. I don\u2019t want to just be some hookup she sees when she\u2019s feeling horny. I want to show love and be loved. I don\u2019t want to be seen as just dick and balls and a man with no heart. It\u2019s not her fault, it\u2019s mine for wanting more. I\u2019m just not lovable. My whole life it\u2019s been the same thing over and over. I was bullied in highschool by people I\u2019d call \u201cfriends\u201d. They shattered my confidence. I have insane confidence and self doubt issues to this day cause of it. That\u2019s another reason why I train mma, I want to be better in life but it\u2019s not working. Almost all the people around my age know what they want in life and are determined to reach these goals. And then there\u2019s me who has nothing going for him other than being able to workout a few hours a day. It\u2019s honestly pathetic. I try my best to hide these feelings. I have and cover them up but I can\u2019t anymore. I want to die. I want to not exist. I want to not hurt anymore. I\u2019m not cut out for life. I just don\u2019t have it. I hope one of these days someone rear ends me on my bike and I die or I might just have to send it into a barricade going 280 km an hr. It would be quick. There\u2019s no other hope for me.",

I could have an aneurysm at any moment. I can picture exactly what it'd feel like \u2014 a thunderclap of pain, a split second of understanding, and then nothing. Or maybe fifteen years from now I'll have a heart attack bc I cant stop smoking even though i know i have to.\n\nwhat am i gonna do when my birds die? they're old, they don't have more than five years left, and then what? they're one of the only reasons im still alive. before my aunt shot herself and suicide was taken off the table i knew i couldn't leave them behind because what would happen to them? sent back to the rescue with more abandonment issues than they started with? what kind of person would that make me, to adopt living creatures and care for them and make them love me only to off myself after two years? but they're going to die. and i'm gonna be living by myself. no real friends, family that i hardly talk to, exhausted by everything and everyone, and knowing i can't complain bc it's all my own damn fault. and then what's gonna happen?\n\ni thought my new antidepressants were working. but i only do well for the first half of the day. and then i sink back down and think about dying and feel terrified or relieved or exhausted. i get high and i get high and i get too high and i have a panic attack and feel like im about to die bc theres nothing else to do. i think about my passions and cant seem to dredge up any desire or interest or feeling. i think about the world and it's just a sort of hopeless muddle because i can't bring myself to think about anything that's happening and i just know it's bad. i think about myself and i know i didnt turn out as well as i thought i would.",
